# odin-recipes
First Odin project; Create a website which display some recipes. Only uses HTML very basics and git.

After project:
It was very confusing, i was noticing random things that needed to be fixed and commited a lot more times than i think it was needed. In general, it was easy, but it a lot longer than expected, but it was worth it.
